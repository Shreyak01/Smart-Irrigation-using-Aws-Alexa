 I have developed an irrigation system on Esp32 device which can be used for watering the plants depending on their mositure levels and also to predict the conditions of plants. 
 This is achieved because of different sensors which have been used for example soil moisture sensor,temperature sensor,rain sensors which will detect moisture level,temperature level and water content in soil present at that time and will display the result to us.
 After this, all the data that has been generated will go to Metabase which is a open source business tool that is used to display the data in the form of charts whether it is a bar chart or pie chart to further predict the conditions of plants.
 I have also used MQTT protocol,Alexa Environment and AWS Setup to store the data on cloud and also to automate the pipe to turn on/off the motor with the help of voice commands from ALexa such as when we command alexa to turn on the motor the motor will turn on and if we command alexa to turn off the motor it wil then turn off the motor accordingly.
